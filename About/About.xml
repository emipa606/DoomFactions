--- Original Description ---
Adds the Union Aerospace Corporation and Space Marine factions in the game. (Non-Hostile)
Also contains DOOM 2016 weapons and sounds

The UAC brings plenty of their products very cheap for sale to the inhabitants of the Rim, but what is their real
intentions behind their deployment? Who are the Space Marines?
	
	
Note: Not combat extended compatible, guys come on. Please. I'm sorry okay? :((
